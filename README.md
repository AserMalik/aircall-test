## Summary

This is my submission for the Speer Technologies coding assessment. I worked on this for roughly 12 hours from cloning to deployment. I stopped here as I hit the indicated deadline.

This was a fun exercise to stretch my React muscles. There is a lot I can improve on and am thankful for the consideration for an assessment.
